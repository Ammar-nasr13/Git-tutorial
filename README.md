## What is Git ?

- It is a local repository that stores all our projects.
- Version Control System. ( VCS ) => This means that when you create a new repository and save your project files in it, it tracks all the changes that will occur to the project files and saves every change that will be made in a separate version, and you can return to any version at any time.
- Work as a team => Each programmer works on his own copy separately without affecting the others, and then all these copies are merged together.
