## What is Git ?

- It is a local repository that stores all our projects.
- Version Control System. ( VCS ) => This means that when you create a new repository and save your project files in it, it tracks all the changes that will occur to the project files and saves every change that will be made in a separate version, and you can return to any version at any time.
- Work as a team => Each programmer works on his own copy separately without affecting the others, and then all these copies are merged together.

## 📌 By using git you can do the following:

- 📝 **Track changes** Any changes to a file are recorded (who made them, when, what was the change).
- 🔙 **Rollback** If something goes wrong, roll back to a clean version of the code.
- 🤝 **Teamwork** Each programmer works on their own version, and then you merge the changes together.
- 🌐 **Distributed** Every device has a full copy of the project, and you don't always need an internet connection.

## How create New Repostory in Git ?

- Open Terminal or Cmd.
- You must make sure that you are inside the project folder.
- git init => Initialized empty Git repository in path ..... => write in cmd dir /a:h to show hidden .git folder. <br>
**.git**
- An empty Git repository in which the project is stored later.
- It contains several files responsible for: <br>
  1- All data related to the repository. <br>
  2- Tracking changes, rolling back to older versions, and working on different branches.
